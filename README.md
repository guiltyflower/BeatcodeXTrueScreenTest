#  Beatcode and TrueScreen's test

This project is an initial test to gain access to a possible interview.
The requirements for the test are as follows:

## Main Part

Develop an app in SwiftUI with the following features:

1)A list of cells with different titles (even something simple like "Cell number X" is fine) and an icon/button to mark an item as a favorite or remove it from favorites with a tap.<br/>
2)Tapping on the cell, excluding the favorite button, opens a detail view with the same features as the cell (title and favorite button).<br/>
3)The favorite status should remain synchronized between the list and the detail view.


## Submission on GitHub:

1)Create a private or public repository on GitHub or any other cloud-based Git system.<br/>
2)Make frequent commits; we’re really interested in seeing the code’s evolution rather than just the final product.


## Extras:

1)Pay attention to the UI, focusing on colors (e.g., different colors for cells or favorite details) and navigation (navigation bar, navigation title, etc.).<br/>
2)Super extra: make the app as accessible as you think is useful (groups, primary and secondary actions, labels).
